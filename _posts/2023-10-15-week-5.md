## Preface

I believe we can say the season is well underway and finally we've had some interesting development. This week we saw 4 teams agree to 2 trades. Fortunately for the Washup Alums, we have our in-house trade analyst to give us his take on the trades.

### Grade Recaps by GLAKevNCY

There were two big trades this week with a common theme: trading strength in running back depth for a potential starting receiver upgrade. Yet there was also a clear contrast in the motivation of the teams trading their running backs: desperation to avoid the pit vs desire to regain the top. 

**Just Joshin’ Yah receives JORDAN ADDISON: A**
**False Start receives DAVID MONTGOMERY: D- (curved to a C)**

The idea seemed right for the False Starts, why have 4 startable running backs and be 0-3 when you could turn one running back into a comparable starting receiver who can start? But for Jordan Addison? The second part of that statement implied he got a starting quality receiver in return, not someone who would ride the bench less effectively than David Montgomery and less as a safety net than Montgomery. Did the owner of the Starts forget he could have maybe gotten Gabe Davis instead? Is Kenny Pickett so bad as a Steeler that he figures Addison must be a savant to have made him look that good in college? The outlook especially looks bleak after Montgomery went off and Addison barely recorded a look by Cousins in a crowded Vikings passing game. Credit the Yahs for being the only suitor and cashing in on the trade. The owner of the False Starts will claim that it was a better trade the day it occurred, which is true but even then it looked pretty one-sided. Here is what different websites were ranking player values before the trade (each resource has a different scale so compare each index directly)

Montgomery: 27, 21, 13, 65
Addison: 11, 18, 9, 50

As sad as 0-3 is, there were still 11 weeks left in the season and the overall signs were there for positive regression for the Starts. Probably just wait and hold more than trade down. Did their front office potentially panic, move too soon, and put his team further behind the sticks than they already are … for the aptly named False Start? He may be thinking about this trade at mile 14 of his marathon.


TRADE 2: 

**Gibbs Free Energy receives Justin Fields, Bijan Robinson, Amari Cooper: A**
**The Pittsburgh Parrots receives Stefon Diggs & Lamar Jackson: C- (curved to a B-)**

While Game of Jones receives all the praise from the early pundits with his big performances, to me the team with the clear best-positioned team was The Pittsburgh Parrots. It had 3 elite running backs (Bijan Robinson, Tony Pollard, and breakout Kyren Williams) that dominated their team's rushes and were in productive running offenses, another cowbell running back waiting in the wings (Brian Robinson), and the second-highest scoring fantasy running back in football in Raheem Mostert (less confident as Dolphins backfield is crowded and too many mouths to feed). The receiver depth of Deebo, Cooper, and Kirk and the QB play of Fields did leave something to be desired but wasn’t bad and still had the team looking to be the best.

So again it makes sense to make a trade (at some point), but when you are arguably the best team it should be the right one as you are in a position of strength. But this trade just doesn’t seem to be that. Bijan for Diggs is close but almost everyone would take Bijan. The Lamar for Fields swap balances this back out and then it looks to be the type of trade you execute on. But then why include Cooper, the 38th overall pick who gives you good receiver depth when you don't need to make a deal yet? It let the trade occur, but it may have made it clearly in the Engery's favor as well.

I still think the Parrots may be the team to beat and maybe they will succeed and the haters will use it as a reason to say I was wrong. But the real question will be not if the Parrots succeed (as their strength is still there) but how the players in this trade fare. Perhaps the Parrots sold at the right time for Fields (not after Thursday?), Cooper (maybe the Browns offense is not OK without Chubb and they are very pessimistic on Watson as Clevelanders), and Robinson (just sell high on an injury-prone position) and Lamar and Diggs are the stars they can be. Or simply the depth of the running backs is consistently there and just getting Diggs is all it takes. 

Then again, there is an old adage in baseball that you can never have too many starting pitchers in April and May (pitchers get hurt a lot and they are susceptible to bad stretches), and on the same note, I am not sure you can really have too much running back depth this early in the year. This trade won’t determine who goes running but may determine who is fat and happy around the holidays. For my personal rivalry with the owner of the Energy, “Baseball runner up”, who surprisingly actually pulled off a trade after I watched him go back and forth with my father for 3 months during the baseball season (is him getting a trade done a sign it is one-sided?), let us hope I am wrong.

## Matchup Recaps 

This week's recap is brought to you by our upcoming podcast "The Three Amigos." The pitch? Imagine Steven A. Smith, Skip Bayless, and Max Kellerman all in their prime and inside of a locked room. All possibly concussed. Let's roll.

### Just Joshin' Yah vs. Running shoes

When I tell you no one expected this... I meant no one expected this. The Joshin' Yahs were the favorites coming into this matchup with a one-game lead over the Running Shoes and sitting dead last in the league. If you were a betting man you'd hammer the under 215 on this game as both teams came in bottom of the league in scoring. However, you would lose that bet as both teams combined for 278 points this week and was the highest-scoring matchup. 

After weeks of weak performances by The Running Shoes, they exploded for 174.82 points, which marks them as the highest performance so far. Ja'Marr Chase contributed 3 tuddies and 192 yards to the total and The Shoes cruized to their first dub of the year. The Yahs did their best to stay in the game with Tyreek Hill and Josh Allen combining for over 50 points. However, it wasn't enough to overcome the explosion that came from The Shoes. Maybe the name change sparked something in the locker room for them. As if donning the shoes was a symbol of their resistance or acceptance of having to run. And if you've accepted the outcome, there is really nowhere else to go but up. Or I guess run. 

The fantasy gods have finally blessed the shoes and maybe just maybe those running shoes won't have to be deployed. But maybe keep the name just in case.

### Tua Lipa with DaBaby vs. Crimson Hawks

Another week and another underwhelming performance by DaBaby. They have only two games in which they have scored more than 100 points and the rest of the weeks they have scored less than 80 points. They sit firmly at the bottom of the power ranking and you have to wonder when their standings will start to reflect that. The answer is not long. Although Cooper Kupp returned from injury for the DaBaby they still could not get much offense going even with Pitts coming alive in Atlanta's offense. 

The Hawks were on the tail end of a two-game losing streak coming into this game. They had become another potential candidate for last place and were looking for a spark to turn things around. Zach Moss answered that call. The Colt's running back tore up the titan's defense translating to 32.5 points for the Hawks. A real shot to the guts for DaBaby is the fact that the Hawks started Austin which got them 0 points and still won!

This loss will push Dababy down to the bottom of the league and are in the middle of building a losing streak with not really many positives to take from. For the Hawks, it's a sigh of relief and a much-needed win. Although both teams have the same record it seems like the Hawks have more of the momentum on their side.




### Gibbs Free Energy vs. Money Back

<img src="assets/img/jacobhelp.jpg" width="300"/>

You'd think the Energys were out there sabotaging their team. Advising the opponent? Preposterous! But maybe it was because he was feeling confident after that stellar performance by his newly acquired player, Fields, so to come across as a humble individual he took the high road to please the media. However, it seems like the Backs did not need any help to deliver a thrashing. Etienne and Kittle combined for 60.6 points and even with the suggestion to start Kamara they would have run away with it. 

For the Backs, this win sets them back on the right track and it seems like the wheels are clicking for a nice run ahead. For an owner who never dabbled in the realms of fantasy or even American football, they might just have a knack for it. As for the Energies, there are a lot more questions than answers. Although the trade was heavily in his favor according to our trade analyst that doesn't necessarily translate to ticks in the win column.

Whatever the case, both teams are in the middle of the pack and will look to differentiate themselves against their peers in the coming weeks. 


### my name's jeff-erson vs. The Pittsburgh Parrots

Some would call them the dark horse to win the league and after this week they might even be a favorite. It's not pretty how they are winning but they are. The Jets came in big for the Jeffersons and sneaked out the dub against the underwhelming Parrots led by their newly acquired QB Jackson. If they had actually kept Fields they would have won this matchup pretty handily... 

However, that's all in retrospect and at the time the owner of the Parrots felt that the trade they proposed would lead to rounding out their team more as they had a lot of bench players they wished to start. The Jeffersons have to be feeling happy about this win as they improve their record to 4-1, propelling themselves to the top ranks of the league. Maybe beginner's luck is a thing, but if it is let the good times keep rolling. 

After a hot start to the season, the Parrots have cooled off and are currently on a 2 game-losing streak. Once a favorite to contend for the top spot in the league have fallen to the middle of the pack. They will look to turn things around and hope that their trade pays off in the long term. 


### Cute n' Cuddly Capybaras vs. False Start

The owner of the False Start must not be reading these recaps because it's the same story every week. Points left on the bench that could have helped them at least make this matchup more competitive. The Capybaras came out in full force behind the backs of their tight end Goedert to steamroll the Starts. Almost every player on the Capybaras was in the double digits in points scored except, surprisingly, King Henry. However, the Capybaras could have sat him and still rode off into the sunset. For the Capybaras this is their second win and a dominant one at that. The owner should feel confident heading into the next week after pulling away and getting some cushion from last place. 

Speaking of last place...

(yes play it)

Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you your dead last team, the False Start. They were in a heated race to the bottom before Racing Shoes finally awoke from their slumber and realized that the point of the game was to score more points than the other team. Something that False Start has not yet been able to do. At this point I sound like a broken record, but if you turn your attention to the power ranking they are a top 5 team! How is this possible? They traded for Addison this week and didn't even play him? The only possible explanation for this other than ineptitude as a GM is that he **WANTS** to run the marathon. Forget winning and losing, forget fantasy, forget football. This man wants to be him:

Run False Starts, run.

### **GAME OF THE WEEK:**
### Game of Jones vs. Fighting Poohs

This was the highly anticipated matchup of the week. Two heavyweights, potential league winners, clashed off in the game of the week. The winner would be officially the top team in the league. Although it wasn't a high-flying, high-scoring game. DJ Moore came to life for the Poohs and put on a spectacular performance that would leave the owner of the Jones barking excuses in sight of his potential loss.

The matchup only got weirder at this point as injury took hold of Pooh's QB Richardson and Devonte Smith and Breida combined for 4 points. At this point, it all came down to the Cowboy's defense and Aaron Jones. Like the owner of the Jones did when sensing defeat, the Pooh's owner taunted his opposition.

There is something philosophical to be said about men from a position of weakness finding excuses to validate their defeat, but it's lost on me currently. Regardless, the ever so clairvoyant Poohs saw their undefeated streak continue with the cowboy's defense faltering and Aaron Jones not playing Monday night.
