## Preface

>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of of incredulity, it was the seaon of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the sprint of hope, it was the winter of despair.

> -Charles Dickens - bigTeddies

Some would argue that week 3 is truly the start of the fantasy season. Now that we've had some more games under our belts, the teams began to be truly stratified. The good from the bad, the bad from the awful, and the awful from last place. In this league, it's fine if your team is hot garage, you just have to hope that there is at least a team that is worse. For some this moment is the best of times as they remain undefeated, or for others it's the worst as they claw and wiggle their way out of the hole they dug. The duality is all but evident, almost a quarter way through the season. Just like Dickens portrayed in his book, "A Tale of Two Cities," it is truly a tale of two leagues.

## Matchup Recaps 

The theme for this week is duality. This may or may not be a thing in future recaps. But regardless let's get into the matchups!

### False Start vs. Gibbs Free Diggawatts

Another week, another loss. The False Starts are one of the teams that just can't seem to get out of their own way. I said earlier in a recap that when a defense is your top scorer, which the Bills were for the False Starts, to the tune of 31 points, it's almost guaranteed that you are riding off into the sunset for that week. Well, I guess there is an exception to that rule, and the False Starts have made one for themselves and it's poor management. Looking at the box score you would've thought that once again the Starts were plagued with injury woes, but Reynolds turned in 3 quarters of offensive plays with 0 targets. That man was just out there running. 

What hurts more is the fact that had the Starts, started any of the three players on the bench, Connor, Sutton, or Doubs, he would have stopped the bleeding that is his fantasy season. If the last three defeats were due to unlucky losses, he has no one to blame but himself for this one.

On the other side of the field stood the Diggawatts, although some would argue a far less talented team, was well managed and squeezed out the win. Although Breida could have been played the result wouldn't have changed if the False "Start"-ed (pun intended) any of the 3 previously mentioned bench players. Lamar had a signature performance but fell short of the rallying Colts which surprised everyone in an overtime thriller. The matchup, like all weeks, came down to Monday night in which AJ Brown hauled in 9 receptions for 131 yards to shut the door on the Starts. On paper and by metrics, the Starts look like the team that should be 2-1 and the Giggawatts 0-3. However, the duality in management, when it comes to starting the right players versus the wrong players will make all the difference. 

### Just Joshin' Yah! vs. Fighting Poohs

<img src="assets/img/shortsrunning.jpeg" width="400"/>

This bereal should tell you all you would need to know about this matchup. Poohs remain undefeated, Joshin Yahs remain defeated. Not much can be said about either team as this was the lowest-scoring matchup this week. Josh Allen and Tyreek Hill did their best to keep the Yahs in the game but the rest of their team acted as deadweight. Some pregame chatter and banter were going on in the discord between the two before the matchup. You know I'm a sucker for some good ol' banter but it got personal with memes flying about. 

Recap of the memes:

Pooh unloaded $81 free agency buckaroos to snag Ford from the waivers this week, marking this season's highest bid for a player, and probably won't get broken. While the owner caught some heat for it in the discord, it seemed to have paid off for him this week. Ford had a Chubb-like stat line and gave the Poohs a commanding lead in the matchup. Whether it was strategic, spiteful, or just a homer move, The Poohs also picked up Pickett after denouncing him in the discord and subsequently dropped by the Yahs. There is something to be said about getting beat by a player that you just dropped to the waivers. It could be that Kenny, himself, was seeking revenge on his old team for cutting him the way they did. All that is certain is that the Yahs will have to find some way to turn the season around to avoid having to do exactly what he posted on the bereal. To run and not to run, is the duality of this fantasy football league. 

### my name's jeff-erson vs. Money Back

This matchup was the runner-up for game of the week. It was a 1 on 1 between two hoopers but one was playing through a nagging knee injury. Some would be hesitant to call it a win when you beat someone who is handicapped. But for the Jeffersons, "A win's a win." 

Although Justin Jefferson has yet to score a touchdown, he has been a monster on the field turning in an average of ~153 yards a game, truly worthy of the number one pick overall. However, it was Kenneth Walker who stole the show for the Jeffersons. The Seahawk's RB went for 156 total yards and 2 touchdowns to give their owner a comfortable lead heading into Monday Night. 

The Backs had a modest showing among most of his players as they were all about hitting their projection lines, except for Davonte Adams. No one knows what was said in the locker room but Davonte Adams came out Monday Night ready to carry the Backs to their 1% chance of winning. And he almost did! Adams caught 13 passes for 172 yards, two of which were tuddies. The. Man. Went. Off. Unfortunately, it was just short of what would have been termed a miraculous comeback. If only the Back's owner started anyone else other than the injured Aiyuk they would have secured their second dub and the standings would have been flipped. Sometimes a questionable tag is all that stands between victory or defeat, glory or humiliation. It's a binary code to obfuscate the confidence of the owner. Someone less risk-averse would immediately swap out the player for someone else, but others would rather roll the dice. To optimization or resolution, the duality of stillness and movement. 

### The Pittsburgh Parrots vs. Cute n' Cuddly Capybaras

Finally, 2 of the 3 teams that have an animal as their team name faced off this week. I imagine that a fierce pirate parrot would pluck the eyes out of a cute bug-eyed and cuddly capybara. As if their names were any indication of the outcome of the battle, the matchup played out exactly as such. The Parrots did most of their damage through their two receivers Samuel and Cooper who combined for 43.2 points. It would seem that was all that was needed for the Parrots to remain undefeated and trout out of the arena unscathed. It's scary to think that if the Parrots had played Raheem Mostert what the damage would have been to the Capybaras. Mostert and really any of the dolphins, in their rout of the Broncos, 70 to 20, put up 41.7 points himself but was left on the bench. You can imagine the horrors that would have befallen the Capybaras if Mostert was on the field for the Parrots. I'd imagine the Capybaras wouldn't be as cute anymore with an ear or two missing. 

The Capybaras have a lot to talk about after that defeat, the talent is there but maybe it's time to start motivating some of the starters with some waiver pickups. The duality of birds and rodents? Yeah, I really don't have one for this one folks. Just keep reading on. 


### Crimson Hawks vs. Game of Jones

I don't need to look at the numbers to say that the Hawks were a victim of misfortune. They were the 4th highest-scoring team but unfortunately had to face the team that had scored the highest this week. Although the Malhomes and Kelce connection was there this week it was not enough combined point to usurp...

(Yes we reuse memes here, cry about it b*tch)

De'Von "Who?" Achane. If you don't know who this man is, well... Neither do I. But the owner of the Jones does.

<img src="assets/img/dan-jerking-himself.png" width="600" height="300"/>

The owner of the Jones is as humble as they come. I mean, c'mon, think of the numerous amount of times that he could have boasted about his many tactful moves in fantasy, his astute management of his team, or the many championship banners he has...

Okay so maybe he just yanks the chain, toots the horn, jerks the - you get the point - when he gets the opportunity, but it's not without merit. The Jones are currently one of the top two Vegas favorites to win it all. The team has a strong start and the good times are rolling. If it was me, I would also be yanking and swanking. But just know that the bigger you build yourself up, the more of a target you become. More envious owners will have that week marked when they play the Jones. Sometimes the loudest man in the room is one of luck and chance rather than skill and intelligence. Humility is a rare trait but we are all sometimes fooled by randomness into thinking we are bigger than we are. To yank or to not yank, that is the duality of man. 

### **GAME OF THE WEEK:**
### Chasin' not last vs. Tua Lipa with DaBaby

Just when it seemed that the Chasin' not last was going to break their dry spell, Atwell showed up in the form of a drought and kept the world in balance. It was almost as if fate itself was willing this team and their owner to run the marathon. Maybe there is a higher power after all and we are witness to it. But what would be the purpose of getting a diabetic man to run 26.2 miles? What higher order does this - anyways I digress. This was the matchup of the week not because it was the highest-scoring matchup. Not because it was necessarily the most exciting, but it was the most improbable outcome. 

Keenan Allen did his best to keep DaBaby in the game by going for 18 receptions for 215 yards. Coming into the final minutes of Monday Night's game, DaBaby's loss was all but assured. However, in the last few seconds of the game where the Rams were essentially playing for pride, the improbable turned into reality. LA mustered a drive that was capped off by a one-yard touchdown by Atwell. This was all it took to give DaBaby the points needed to be crowned the victor this week. 

For the not lasts it's another nail in the coffin as both Chase and Williams did their best to prevent another tick in the loss column as they combined for 41.7 points. The duality of probability and determinism can be the knife that cuts the line between a narrow victory and a harrowing defeat.
