## Preface

Can you believe it's already been 4 weeks? Time flies when you're having fun! Or at least for some of us. For others, it's been a grueling and tear-soaked season, filled with close losses. Week 4 is the time when teams that have been performing well start building an ego, while teams that have not lived up to expectations start eyeing that panic button.

There may have been some chatter in the trade room as of late but no transaction as of yet. But I have a feeling that we'll see some players shift teams in the coming weeks... (I definitely wrote this before the trades, definitely not a week late). 

Regardless, I would like to remind everyone that it's still early in the season. Lots of football to be played still and lots of fantasies still yet to be explored. 

## Matchup Recaps 

Big shoutout again to our part-time resident beat writer @Moonman for cranking this one out. 

### False Start vs. My Name's Jeff-erson

Another week, another L for team False Start. They entered Week 4 with a 0-3 record and even with a monstrous 33.1-point performance by David Montgomery they still managed to lose. Tank Dell and TJ Hockensen put up a disappointing performance with a combined 6 points. Jaylen Waddle came back from injury but against a strong Buffalo defense, he was unable to score. On the other hand, Cole Kmet had a huge win for The Jeffs, with a season-high 24.1 points. 

At this point, False Start is bad and looking worse. They had a pre-done deal with Just Joshin Ya's and traded away David Montgomery for Jordan Addison. Now this might not be so bad, considering the glut of RBs in False Start's team, but at the moment it looks baaddddd. We'll have to see what the end of the season brings us. 

### Money Back vs. ThePittsburghParrots

Money Back eked out the win this week behind a surprising Russel Wilson performance against the Bears. It doesn't really feel like they won this game as much as The Parrots lost this game. Justin Fields had a great game with 27 points and Bijan Robinson was great as ever but the 2 WR's and TE all combined for a measly 6 points. Even a heroic performance by Kyren Williams couldn't save them. What has to sting worst of all is they lost this matchup by 2 points on a week when their kicker scored 0 points. If he had scored anything, field goal, extra point, ANYTHING they probably take this one. 

This was The Parrot's first loss of the season. A heartbreaker to be sure as they are now out of the undefeated club. However, they can take heart in the fact that they are still one of the top teams in the league. The Backs just have to thank their lucky stars for this win and prepare for the week ahead. 

### Gibbs Free Diggawatts vs. Cute n Cuddly Capybaras

Just a dominant performance by Gibbs Free Diggawatts this week. Out of the gate, the players were on a mission to score. Stefon Diggs and A.J Brown both put up a fantastic 33-point performance with Lamar Jackson continuing his stretch of great games with 28 points. The Capybaras tried, they had a dominant performance from Derrick Henry and Josh Jacobs but it just wasn't enough. Kirk Cousins had a bad game and the Steelers Defense had such a bad game they actually cost this team 6 points. 

It was a great win for Gibbs Free Energy but a concerning development has come into play here for their namesake Jahmyr Gibbs. It seems that Detroit drafted him to be the backup. Even with David Montgomery returning from an injury he just doesn't get enough targets. While he escaped the L today due to strong performances from his WR's maybe it's time for The Gibbs Free Diggawatts to look for another RB. 

### Crimson Hawks vs. Just Joshin Yah!

Crimson Hawks continue their skid into the bottom trenches of the league. Pitiful performances from most of their players with the only players scoring above 10 points being Patrick Mahomes and the kicker Harrison Butker. On the other hand, Josh Allen had a shootout against a Miami defense that clobbered the Broncos. Nico Collins also had a gem of a game to lead this team to victory.

A much needed win for The Yahs who faced some injury woes at the start of the season. The good news is they have a bonafide RB1 now with their trade with False Start and all they had to give up was a Jordan Addison with 0 points this week! Will this be the start of them running the table? After all both Buffalo and Miami look on a roll this season so that means guaranteed points from Josh Allen and Tyreek Hill. However, it looks like the Crimson Hawks might skid back into the bottom of the league, a tough position for the Glancy household. Who will be the one running? 

### Fighting Poohs vs. Chasin' not last

Chasin' Not Last might have a name change coming for him in the future after this week's pitiful performance. They are still searching for that elusive win. It's of course not entirely their fault. Who could have known that the Cincinnati offense would sputter this much?  At least Adam Thielen is putting in some consistent points so that his team is not entirely talent-depleted, but it's looking mighty thing right now. On the other hand, the Fighting Poohs are looking great. Sure some accuse them of having luck on their side, after all, they have faced the least amount of points this season, but I think those people are just a tad salty. 

This is a great team here, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Dj Moore have been consistent and productive. No one's going to remember all the talk about "luck" at the end of the season. All they'll remember is the W's which the Fighting Poohs seem to have a lot of. 

This matchup leaves Running Shoes at the bottom with team False Start. Both teams are still searching for their first win. Who will come out on top? Who will have to run the marathon? If it's a tie should they meet up halfway and both run a marathon? Like tag team it?

### **GAME OF THE WEEK:**
### Game of Jones vs. Tua Lipa with DaBaby
This was the game of the week not because it was the most exciting or close game. But it was to pay homage to what some consider the best team in the league and it's not hard to see why. CMC had a *monstrous* performance with 45 points. Top that off with 25 points from De'Von Achane, Puka Nacua, and the Cowboy's Defense and you have a recipe for success right there. 

Tua Lipa unfortunately falls again after an impressive set of wins. There just weren't enough points to go around this week, with their highest scorer being the Jaguars defense at 21 points. Despite this loss, however, Tua Lipa should feel good about themselves. They go into Week 5 with their first-round pick Cooper Kupp coming off the IR. 

Will Game of Jones be the overall winner at the end of the season? At this point who else can beat them? They've scored more than 130 points each week so far. If this continues, and it looks like it might, then this season feels like a foregone conclusion.
