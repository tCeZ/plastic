Welcome to week 2, you fantasy addicts! We're back just in time before the bulk of week 3 games kickoff - so technically not behind, behind on schedule. But you know me, as the season pans out, I hope I'm only a week or two behind! But if we get more ghostwriters and such we might just be able to brave it through without too much laggard. Anyway, we've had some minor changes to the league in which two teams changed their league name, therefore to not confuse anyone we will announce it publicly. 

**Chubb-y Bunnies** -> **Tua Lipa with DaBaby**
**Team Friermuthin'** -> **Chasin' not Last**

Very fitting name changes! After that "Can't show on national TV" injury to Chubbs, the owner decided to rebrand to boost the morale in the locker room. One might think that's a bit audacious and cruel, but hey, if you're broke we ain't playing you!

Likewise, for the owner of, now now-named, Chasin' not Last, it's a morale booster in the sense that their goal or mission for this year is embroidered in their name. Although everyone else is fighting for a spot to be crowned champion, it seems the not Lasts are chasing a different goal. And knowing the owner's history, I think I can respect it. 

## Matchup Recaps

This week's matchup recap was brought to you by our friend and fellow league participant **Moonman**! Big shoutout to him for writing up a great recap, enjoy!

### Gibbs Free Diggawatts vs. My Name's Jeff-erson

Call this the battle of the inconsistent QBs. Both teams here have Quarterbacks who *should* be great but have a wild discrepancy of points. We saw this once again with this game but with a reverse of situations. 
Lamar Jackson came back in force after only scoring a pitiful 6 points in week 1. Against a stout Cincinnati defense, he put up 22.88 points for Diggawatts as the clear-cut highest scorer on both teams including the benches. Unfortunately, it was Trevor Lawrence's turn to s*** the bed. Against the Chiefs, he put up a pitiful 9 points scoring no touchdowns and fumbling the ball once. This went from bad to worse for My Name Jeff-erson when the highly touted Jet's Defense put up -1 points. It's a tall order for any team to come back after that, even with Justin Jefferson. In the end, Gibbs Free Diggawatts rode his QB and the Tampa Bay Defense to a 102-77 victory over My Name Jeff-erson. 
This week 2 matchup now leaves both teams 1-1. The QB question remains, however. Will Lamar Jackson stay consistent like he was in his MVP year? Or will he regress to the inconsistency from last year? Will Trevor Lawrence take that final step to become an elite QB? Or should My Name's Jeff-erson be prepared to have a QB carousel with Lawrence and Geno Smith? Only time will tell. 

### Cute n Cuddly Capybaras vs. Money Back
The matchup was tough....until it wasn't. ESPN predicted that these two teams would be within 2 points of each other but the box score tells us Capybaras won in abundance. What happened? QBs happened. S****ing the bed happened. Kirk Cousins took the lead and scored a heroic 4 touchdowns for 28 fantasy points while Deshuan "the Massagonist" Watson crumpled in a controversial game against Pittsburgh. He wasn't the only one however as Travis Etienne Jr and Dameon Pierce, projected to score 13 points each, shat the bed and put up a measly 5 points each. Not even a strong performance from CeeDee Lamb and his 19 points could save the Money Backs. In contrast, Capybaras had strong performances from the Steeler's Defense and, surprisingly, Gabe Davis who put up 18 fantasy points. 
Not much else to say about this game. Both teams are now 1-1, right next to each other in the standings based on other statistics. At least both teams can say they started near the best team possible, unlike our next game. 

### Game of Jones vs. Just Joshin Yah!
It was a repeat of performances for Game of Jones and Just Joshin Yah. Once again Game of Jones had some amazing performances from their team while Just Joshin Yah's left their best team on the bench. 
Starting us off Game of Jones' decision to pick up Puka Nakua came in big as he scored a fantastic 22 points against a tough 49-ers defense. After that, the hits kept coming for Game of Jones as Christian McCaffrey and Mike Evans, both, put up more than 20 points. The Cowboy's defense wasn't playing the Giants so no 37-point bomb but they put up a respective 16. Now Just Joshin Yah *might* have been able to win this but they decided to trot out their B team for this performance. They left 24 points from Nico Collins and 17 points from Jayden Reed just sitting on the bench. This performance might work when you're playing against the scrubs but Game of Jones looks championship-bound at this stage of the game. You have to make better decisions than that if you're trying to beat a great team.
This game puts Game of Jones at the top and Just Joshin Yah at the bottom. This writer knows it's not fun to be at the bottom of the table but like False Start at least Just Joshin Yah's has put up good performances in the former weeks. Will it persist? Maybe, after all, they have a good team but there are no moral victorys in fantasy. Just have to wait and see what the end of the season brings. 

### Tua Lipa with DaBaby vs. Fighting Poohs
An absurdly unlucky team vs. a hot team. Before we even begin with the performance recap can we acknowledge how shitty it must feel for Tua Lipa? They've now lost their 1st round pick (Nick Chubb) and their 2nd round pick (Cooper Kupp) to very serious injury. Sure Kupp might come back later in the year but there's a lot of football between that and stuff like this might cause them to fall into a hole they can't dig themselves out of. 
But anyway let's bring it back to the performances. Even here Tua Lipa doesn't get any help from her team. Highly touted Kyle Pitts continues to be a**. The Packer's defense is not allowed to look good twice in a row so after a strong 14-point performance in week 1 they drop an egg here. Keenan Allen tried to save the team with 27 points but it didn't matter. In contrast, the Fighting Poohs managed to take advantage of the Giant's comeback with 24 points from Saquon Barkley. Surely now the Fighting Poohs can ride their first-round pick to the top and win in Fantasy. Right? Oh, Saquon has a high ankle sprain. Maybe next year Fighting Poohs. 
I kid. Fighting Poohs picked up both Kareem Hunt and Jerome Ford. With another #1 RB under their belt, they just might be able to run the table and rack up the wins while Dua Lipa struggles with injury issues. 

### Chasin not Last vs. Crimson Hawks
Unlike our game of the week, these two teams went into this matchup with some serious pessimism. Both teams had bad week 1s and were looking to rebound to avoid another repeat of last year where they struggled for last place at the end of the year. Two losers fighting head to head. At least someone's got to win. 
The Crimson Hawks came through with a fine showing scoring the second-highest points of the week. Mahomes is always good, even when he's bad, but it was the stunning performances of D'Andre Swift, Tee Higgins, and Tyler Lockett that saved the day. All of them scored over 20 points catapulting Crimson Hawks to a victory. On the other hand Chasin Not Last doesn't seem to be looking too good. True they put up a hundred points but their top players are looking mighty thin in the points department. Ja'Marr Chase put up another stinker performance with 5 points. Najee Harris, the second-round pick, picked up a measly 4.8 points. ESPN says that the highest-rated player on Chasin Not Last's team is the Saints Defense. Oof. 
So the Crimson Hawks saves his son from having to run a marathon and the Chasin not Last ends up in the bottom again. They've got a good matchup coming up with Tua Lipa in week 3 that *should* see them win but well we've been here before ladies and gentlemen and the last time it ended in pancakes. 

### **GAME OF THE WEEK:**
### The Pittsburgh Parrots vs. False Start

What a game! The writer may be biased but for his money, this was the game of the week. 
At the start, both teams came in with confidence. Pittsburgh Parrots were feeling good after a tremendous showing from Bijan Robinson and Tony Pollard in week 1. On the other side, False Start picked up another Packers QB to replace the injured Aaron Rodgers and while the first-round pick Austin Ekeler was injured it didn't seem like False Start would have any trouble in the running back department with strong RBs like Joe Mixon, James Connor, and David Montgomery.
The matchup started with a bang as TJ Hockenson picked up 22 points for False Start. This kickstarted an early lead for False Start with James Connor putting up 16 pts against an abysmal Giants team with Joe Mixon and David Montgomery putting in 11 pts a piece. Victory seemed certain for False Start until the Pittsburgh Parrots started to put up points in chunks. With 19 points each from Bijan Robinson and Deebo Samuel along with a host of players putting up at least fifteen points. It all came down to the final game, Miami vs. New England. Jaylen Waddle vs. Raheem Mostert. Both teams played hard but in the end, Raheem Mostert's 25-point outing helped clear the way for a Parrot's victory over the False Starts.
With this matchup, the Pittsburgh Parrots are now 2-0 and False Start is 0-2. Will the owner of False Start have to run the marathon? Well, Fantasy is a marathon in itself and after two strong weeks surely the team is due for some wins...right?
