# Week 1 Fantasy Recap 

## Preface

Welcome back you Washed Up Alums! Another year of fantasy football is upon us, and I, your ever-dutiful commissioner, bigTeddies, couldn't be more excited! Wealth, fame, power, and ~~pancakes~~ sweat await you. Will you bask in the glory of being crowned this year's fantasy champion? Or will you be sweating your way through 26 miles? Only time will tell but remember fortune favors the **bold**, so take some risks, but you probably should *start running*.

Before we get to the meat and potatoes, we have a time-honored bound tradition of acknowledging the previous year's winner at the start of the new season - let's give a round of applause and tip our hats to our champion from last year... 

![check notes](assets/img/checknotes.png)

Cortez! Sadly, he is not with us anymore to receive his flowers, because like every competitive league we promptly kicked him out after he won.

But like they say out with the old, in with the new. The league has expanded to 12 teams this year and we have a couple of fresh new faces as well. I introduce you to your new colleagues:

- my name's jeff-erson (Emre)

>Hey guys, I’m Emre! I met Ted through basketball and have not been able to get rid of him since, unfortunately. I’m not a huge football guy, but I’m an even less marathon guy so hoping to do my best this season!

- Money Back (Jacob)

>Hey guys I’m Jacob! I also met Ted through basketball. I know nothing about football and I joined the league purely because of the love I have for him (well maybe the confidence in my luck too). The first week went pretty well for me with the random players auto draft picked for me. I hope the luck does not run out.

- The Pittsburgh Parrots (Mikhaila)

>Hello, I'm Mikhaila, and I generally have a STRONG dislike for football. That said, Ted was effective in recruiting me to the league this year, and I’ve joined with the support of my GM, Austin, who actually knows what a pick six means. Looking forward to being on the inside of all the fantasy drama this year and walking away a champion!

- Chubb-y Bunnies (Elseebs)

>Hello, I'm Elseebs. I've known Ted since he found me in the dumpster 4 years ago and he selflessly gave me a place to stay. The only thing I know about football is Patrick Mahomes. My game strategy is to pick players with the strongest energy waves.

## Matchup Recaps

Now without further ado let's get to the matchup recaps. 

### Gibbs Free Diggawatts vs. The Pittsburgh Parrots

`Live by Lamar, Die by Lamar` - False Start Owner. 

Those words would come to haunt the Diggawatts as they stumbled out of the gates this week. Not only did Lamar have a lackluster performance, Drake London laid a goose egg! Talk about playing with a man down! You'd expect this kind of mistake from one of the rookies but a seasoned veteran and a prior league winner?? SMH. The rest of the Diggawatts were also nothing to write home about. Only 3 players on the team even scored double digits, it's surprising they were not at the bottom of the power ranking. The takeaway here is no one is infallible and one's fantasy team can sometimes be a great lesson in humility.

The Parrots are one of the new franchise teams in the league and showcased a natural aptitude for fantasy management. Drafting Bijan seemed like a risky move for their first pick but it seemed to have paid out for the Parrots this week. Maybe the Parrots felt some kind of semblance towards the fellow newcomer or maybe someone else who is more knowledgeable about the state of football is operating the controls. Either way, the Parrots plowed their way through the Diggawatts on the backs of their top two picks and never looked back. 

### my name's jeff-erson vs. Cute n' Cuddly Capybaras

Honestly one of the more compelling games this week. It would have been the game of the week if not for how abysmal Josh Allen performed on Monday Night. But by most standards, this was a game that kept you on the edge of your seat. If you didn't know better you would have thought that the Jeffs' owner was a big Seattle Seahawks fan, but by his intro, it seems he's just another statistic to bias people towards "beginner's luck". Although Geno and the squad didn't quite bring their A game, Justin Jefferson and Monday Night Football gave the necessary push for the Jeffs to beat the Capybaras with a comfortable lead.

Speaking of the Capybaras, if there was a team you were rooting for other than yourself this would be the team here. They were the dark horse in last year's playoff and truly a Cinderella story in the making after starting with one of the worst records. However, it's all in the past and this time they were actually able to draft! If it wasn't for Goedert the Capybaras would have closed the scoring gap a bit more. The Capybaras seem to have a star in the making with Ridley after not playing for a year and hopefully, if all the dots connect they could make another run in the playoffs. That's if they remember to set their lineups.

### Money Back vs. False Start 

Whoever said the ESPN auto-pick is trash, their team is probably not as good as the Money Backs. But it's not just the picks, the team management was stellar for a rookie owner. Putting Aiyuk in for Thomas essentially won the matchup for the Backs, who had a monster performance to the tune of 129 yards and 2 touchdowns. But maybe they got a little lucky with some key opponent injuries? It seems truly that lady luck is on the side of the Money Backs. Frankly, I rather be lucky than good. Especially when it comes to fantasy. But I think the ESPN auto-picker deserves a shoutout. It cooked.

For a team that hates losing the False Starts are quite good at it. The owner was ready to leave the league for good, complaining about how they were just "unlucky" and never winning. Well, I have news for you buddy, if you are losing, just win, duh. Okay, well maybe for this week the Starts had a reason to complain about his woes, Rodgers played a total of 4 snaps before calling it a wrap for the season with an Achilles tear. However, it seems more like a mismanagement of personnel. The False Starts had the most bench points out of all the teams with Dak, his second-string quarterback, barely having to throw. If that's not an indicator of bad team management I don't know what is. All in all, it is the first week, and sometimes players have to give you a reason to start them and maybe that's what the Starts were looking for. 

### Game of Jones vs. Team Friermuthin'

Two words. Pure Domination. I almost had to censor this write-up to not violate the terms of agreement due to how badly the Jones violated the Friermuthins. This is some roommate-on-roommate beating, and I'm not talking about the meat kind either. The Jones got off to a red-hot start with McCaffrey scorching the Stiller's defense and pretty much never had to look back. The cherry on top was the Cowboy's defense muffling the Giants. When your defensive unit is your top scorer you know it's going to be a field day. It wouldn't be surprising to see some regression in later weeks but for now, the Jones are riding high and I'm not talking about his opponent's owner. 

Not only did the Friermuthins have the worst week out of all the teams, this might be the worst performance ever in our league (source: me - but actually fact-check me cause I'm too lazy, ESPN API is some ass). Friermuthin's kicker scored negative points, I mean - c'mon. Whether something was said in the locker room, who knows, but Gano came out with the goal to miss every single field goal - quite to the spirit of the Giants. It's funny because when someone says you might be bad at fantasy, that is almost equivalent to saying you are bad at rolling dice, but after this performance by the Friermuthins, whoever said that (*cough* False Starts *cough*), might be right. This is not the type of performance that inspires confidence after the Friermuthins came in last the year prior. I guess those pancakes didn't deter the owner and maybe encouraged him. It's like he's saying "Let's run it back." but for last place. Maybe he's playing a different game than the rest of us, but there is something to be said about back-to-back last-place finishes. One could say it's almost as impressive as winning back-to-back. Just without the allure and a lot more pancakes and sweat than necessary. Regardless it's a long season so time will tell if the Friermuthin' can turn it around. 

### Fighting Poohs vs. Crimson Hawks

This matchup was the equivalence of watching two old arthritic men slugging it out. For every punch thrown, it was like you were seeing the bones and structure deteriorating in real-time. If you watched long and hard enough you'd have thought there was a glitch in the matrix. I mean Joe Burrow had almost the same amount of points starting the game when it ended. Saquon fumbled and folded in front of the Cowboy's defense like some thot and the only shining light on the team was maybe St.Brown and Smith who probably immediately requested trades after this week. The Poohs were fortunate to have played the second-worst team this week because they were the third-worst team. I don't even know if you can call it a win, but it is what it is. Just like how some teams were unlucky, some teams were lucky. And this is more of a situation of the latter. 

Crimson Hawks (Pooh's daddy) seemed to have been competing with the Friermuthin' on who could score the least points. But they couldn't keep the reigning last-place team from losing harder - Pause, I apologize Grant I usually keep the jabs in their respective sections, but gawd damn! 

The only players that did much of anything for the Hawks were Mahomes and Pittman Jr., the rest were practically non-existent with 3 players close to 0 points! Talk about a week you want to forget! There have been rumors swirling that the owner of the Hawks "does not care about fantasy," because unlike everyone else in the league, the owner does not need to fear the punishment. The Fighting Poohs, in the case that the Hawks come in last, will take on the mantle and volunteer as tribute - quite the endearing son. The Poohs can't be feeling good about their chances of not coming in last place this year. Should there be an additional punishment for the Poohs if both of these teams finish at the bottom? Like two marathons to run? Back-to-Back?

### **GAME OF THE WEEK:** 
### Just Joshin' Yah! vs. Chubb-y Bunnies
<img src="assets/img/sc.JPEG" width="300"/>

You have to love the chit-chat. This is what fantasy is all about. Trash talk, and then rubbing it in your opponent's face. The Chubb-y Bunnies are a fantasy class act. Before the matchup, it seemed like the Yahs were going to be favorites after the Bunnies' star receiver, Cooper Kupp got sent to the gulag, otherwise known as the Injury Reserve. But if anything this was more of a rallying cause for the team to come out and bust all over the Yahs. 

If anyone got the message it was Tua, who came out slinging for 466 yards and 3 tuddies. Although for any other matchup, this would have been spectacular, the Yahs had Tyreek who was the primary recipient of Tua's throws. Therefore if anything due to the nature of fantasy scoring favored the Yahs. Tyreek Hill broke out for 39 points on his way to 11 receptions, 215 yards, and 2 tuddies stateline. Whenever one of your players scores almost 40 points that is almost a guaranteed dub. However, that was not the case for the Yahs. 

Not only did they suffer a season-ending injury to their starter J.K. Dobbins, but Josh Allen had one of his worst, if not THE worst, career performances. At the start of Monday night, The Yahs had almost an 80% chance of winning according to ESPN but due to 4 turnovers by the Herald namesake, he would fall to the Bunnies. Talk about hard-to-swallow defeat, the Yahs are in contention to win this year's most choked-up team award. But I reckon the Yahs will continue to start Allen and toss this up as a blimp on the radar. The Bunnies should be happy they were able to steal a win while they have Kupp on the mend and hopefully not lose too much ground.
