# Week 1 Fantasy Recap 

## Preface

Welcome back you Washed Up Alums! Another year of fantasy football is upon us, and I, your ever dutiful commissioner, bigTeddies, couldn't be more excited! Wealth, fame, power, and ~~pancakes~~ sweat awaits you. Will you bask in the glory of being crowned this year's fantasy champion? Or will you be sweating your way through 26 miles? Only time will tell but remember fortune favors the **bold**, so take some risks, but you probably should *start running*. :smirk:

Before we get to the meat and potatoes, we have a time honored bound tradition of acknowedging the previous year's winner at the start of the new season - let's give a round of applauds and tip our hats to our champion from last year... 

![check notes](assets/img/checknotes.png)

Cortez! Sadly, he is not with us anymore to recieve his flowers. Like every competitive league we promptly kicked him out after he pocketed our money. 

But like they say out with the old, in with the new. The league has expanded to 12 teams this year and we have a couple of fresh new faces as well. I introduce you to your new fellow collegues:

- my name's jeff-erson (Emre)

>Hey guys, I’m Emre! I met Ted through basketball and have not been able to get rid of him since, unfortunately. I’m not a huge football guy, but I’m an even less marathon guy so hoping to do my best this season!

- Money Back (Jacob)

>Hey guys I’m Jacob! I also met Ted through basketball. I know nothing about football and I joined the league purely because of the love I have for him (well maybe the confidence in my luck too). The first week went pretty well for me with the random players autodraft picked for me. I hope the luck does not run out.

- The Pittsburgh Parrots (Mikhaila)

>Hello, I'm Mikhaila, and I generally have a STRONG dislike for football. That said, Ted was effective in recruiting me to the league this year, and I’ve joined with the support of my GM, Austin, who actually knows what a pick six means. Looking forward to being on the inside of all the fantasy drama this year and walking away a champion!

- Chubb-y Bunnies (Elseebs)

>Hello, I'm Elseebs. I've known Ted since he found me in the dumpster 4 years ago and he selflessly gave me a place to stay. The only thing I know about football is Patrick Mahomes. My game strategy is to pick players with the strongest energy waves.

## Matchup Recaps

Now without further ado let's get to the matchup recaps. 

### Gibbs Free Diggawatts vs. The Pittsburgh Parrots

`Live by Lamar, Die by Lamar` - False Start Owner. 

Those words would come to haunt the Diggawatts as they stumbled out of the gates this week. Not only did Lamar have a lackluster performance, Drake London laid a goose egg! Talk about playing with a man down! You'd expect this kind of mistake from one of the rookies but a seasoned vetern and a prior league winner?? The rest of the Diggawatts were also nothing to right home about. Only 3 players on the team even scoring double digits, it's surprising they were not at the bottom of the power ranking. If anything this is a great lesson in humility, no one is infalliable and one's fantasy team can sometimes be the awakening. 

The Parrots are one of the new franchise teams to the league and showcased a natural aptitude for fantasy management. Drafting Bijan seemed like a risky move for their first pick but it seemed to have paid out for the Parrots this week. Maybe the Parrots felt some kind of symbiance towards the fellow newcomer or maybe someone else who is more knowledgable about the state of football is operating the controls. Either way the Parrots plowed their way through the Diggawatts on the backs of their top two picks and never looked back. 

### my name's jeff-erson vs. Cute n' Cuddly Capybaras

Honestly one of the more compelling games this week. It would have been the game of the week if not for how abysmal Josh Allen performed on Monday Night. But by most standards this was a game that kept you on the edge of your seats. If you didn't know better you would have thought that the Jeffs' owner was a big Seattle Seahawks fan, but by his intro it seems he's just another statistic to bias people towards "beginner's luck". Although Geno and the squad didn't quite bring their A game, Justin Jefferson and Monday Night Footbal gave the neccessary push for the Jeffs' to beat the Capybaras with a comfortable lead.

Speaking of the Capybaras, if there was a team you were rooting for other than yourself this would be the team here. They were the dark horse in last year's playoff and truly a cinderella story in the making after starting with one of the worst records. However, it's all in the past and this time they were able to actually make the draft! If it wasn't for Goedert the Capybaras would have made this matchup a bit closer. The Capybaras seem to have a star in the making with Ridley after not playing for a year and hopefully if all the dots connect they could make another run in the playoffs. That's if they remember to set their lineups.

### Money Back vs. False Start 

Whoever said the ESPN autopick is trash, their team is probably not as good as the Money Backs. But it's not just the picks, the team management was stellar. Putting Aiyuk in for Thomas essentially won the matchup for the Backs, who had a monster performance to the tune of 129 yards and 2 touchdowns. But maybe they got a little lucky as well with Aaron Rodgers getting injured only 4 snaps into his tenure with the Jets. Regardless, the Backs should be happy with a well deserved win, but also thank their lucky stars that the autopicks cooked. 

The False Start complain and we laugh and brush it off, but do they have a point when they say they are just "unlucky?" Well maybe for this week, if the Rodgers injury didn't happen there would be more potential for them to edge past the Money Backs. However, it seems more like a mismanagement of personell. They had the most points

### Game of Jones vs. Team Friermuthin'

Two words. Pure Domination. I almost had to censor this writeup to not violate terms of agreement due to how bad the Jones' violated the Friermuthin's. This is some roommate on roomate thrashing, and I'm not talking about the fun kind either. 

### Fighting Poohs vs. Crimson Hawks

This matchup was the equivalence of watching two old arthritic dudes slug it out in a mud fight. Cause for every punch thrown it was like it was hurting them more than it hurt the other person.

You have to love the chit chat. This is what fantasy is all about. Trash talk, and then rubbing it in your opponent's face. The Chubb-y Bunnies are a class fantasy act.
